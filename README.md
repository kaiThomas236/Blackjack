# Blackjack


I am making a simple game of blackjack in order to teach myself working go!
I'm really liking this language so far. Feel free to check this out or run it on your machine if you want to play!
This was quite the challenge because I had no idea how to program in Go and no idea how to play blackjack! But I learned both and made this fun little game. It's pretty short so go ahead and give it a try.
